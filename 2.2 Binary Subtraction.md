# Binary Subtraction
Lets look at the numbers **00011011** and **00001010**

Binary subtraction is harder than binary addition, but do not fear! We'll walk through it step by step.

Figure 2.3

After setting up the problem, like in figure 2.3, there are four possibilities.
1. 0 - 0 = 0
2. 1 - 0 = 1
3. 1 - 1 = 0
4. 0 - 1 = We cannot carry in this instance, so we borrow 1 from the next column. This makes **0 - 1 = 1** but remember that it also affects the next column since we borrowed the 1.

So lets take this step by step:

### Lets double check that!
You should ALWAYS double check your work and the best way to do that with binary math is to convert it to something more familiar. However since conversions will be covered later on in *Chapter 3*, they will be given for this example.

Lets look at the original Figure 2.3:
![](https://github.com/reedmeyer1/Binary-Math-Tutorial/blob/master/2.2%2001.png?raw=true)
The sky number, **0011011**, is equal to **27** and the orange number, **00001010**, is equal to **10**. We know that **27 - 10 = 17**, so our solution, **00010001**, should be equal to **17**, which it is. Conversions will be covered in further depth in *Chapter 3*.
