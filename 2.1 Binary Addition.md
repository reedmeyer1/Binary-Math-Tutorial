# Binary Addition
Lets look at the numbers **00000100** and **00000011**

Figure 2.1

After setting up the problem, like in figure 2.1, there are four possibilities as you work through the problem.
1. 0 + 0 = 0
2. 1 + 0 = 1
3. 1 + 1 = 0, carry the one
4. 1 + 1 + 1 = 1, carry the one

Try applying these rules to figure 2.1 above. You should come up with something like figure 2.2

### Lets double check that!
You should ALWAYS double check your work and the best way to do that with binary math is to convert it to something more familiar. However since conversions will be covered later on in *Chapter 3*, they will be given for this example.

Lets look at the original Figure 2.1:
![](https://github.com/reedmeyer1/Binary-Math-Tutorial/blob/master/2.1%2001.png?raw=true)
The blue number, **00000100**, is equal to the decimal number **4** and the red number, **00000011**, is equal to the number **3**. Meaning adding the values **00000100** and **00000011** in binary is the same as adding the more familiar **3** and **4**. Since we know **3 + 4 = 7**, then **00000111** should be equal to **7**, which it is. The conversion process will be covered to a more full extent in *Chapter 3*.
