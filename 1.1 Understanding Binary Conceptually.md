# Understanding Binary Conceptually
## What is Binary?
Binary is a number system, like the decimal system. However, the decimal system is a base 10 number system, while the binary is a base 2 number system.
##### What does "Base #" mean?
Lets look at the more familiar decimal system. Count up to 20 from 0, but keep an eye out for a pattern.

`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20`

Notice anything? From **0** to **9** are unique numbers, every number after that is simply a hybrid of the original ten numbers. For example, the number **15** is the combination of **1** and **5**. The number of unique values in a number system determines its **Base Number**. So the decimal system is **Base 10** because it has ten unique values (0 through 9).

So lets look at the binary number system. Since this is a **Base 2** system there are only two unique values, **0** and **1**. The combination of these values is what ultimately decides the final number value.
##### Understanding the Use of Binary
Binary is ideal for computers. A computer at its most simplistic level only knows when a circuit is **on** or **off**. Computers use a complex system of these circuits in tandem with Binary to interpret a multitude of **on/off** states that ultimately allows you to check your email or browse the web. Binary is ideal for this because it is a base 2 system, meaning it only has two unique values, **0** and **1**. 

But if binary number system can only be **1** or **0**, then why are there eight numbers in a binary number?

That is because of the way computers store information. Since any number can either be a **1** or **0**, computers use eight of these numbers, otherwise called **bits**, next to each other to store information in a **byte**.
