# Binary Multiplication
Lets look at the numbers **00010011** and **00000111**

Figure 2.4

After setting up the problem, like in figure 2.4, there are three possibilities.
1. 0 * 0 = 0
2. 1 * 0 = 0
3. 1 * 1 = 1

Try applying these rules to figure 2.4 above. You should come up with something like figure 2.5

### Lets double check that!
You should ALWAYS double check your work and the best way to do that with binary math is to convert it to something more familiar. However since conversions will be covered later on in *Chapter 3*, they will be given for this example.

Lets look at the original Figure 2.4:
![](https://github.com/reedmeyer1/Binary-Math-Tutorial/blob/master/2.3%2001.png?raw=true)
The green number, **00010011**, is equal to **19** and the purple number, **00000111**, is equal to **7**. We know that **19 * 7 = 133**, so our solution, **10000101**, should be equal to **133**, which it is. Conversions will be covered in further depth in *Chapter 3*.
