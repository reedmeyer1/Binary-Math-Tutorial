# Decimal to Binary

Converting from a decimal number to a binary number requires a slightly different approach. Instead of referencing values and exponents, we will instead take a step by step approach to the conversion process.

Lets look at the number **140**

### Step by Step:
1. Divide by 2 and record the remainder

2. Repeat step 1 until you divide to zero

3. Take the remainder values and reverse their order

This means that the decimal number **140** is equivalent to the binary number **10001100**.
