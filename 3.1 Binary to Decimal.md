
# Binary to Decimal

As we established in *Chapter 1.2: Reading Binary* each place in a binary number is associated with an exponent and a value.

| Table 1.1 | | | | | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Exponent** | 2^7 | 2^6 | 2^5 | 2^4 | 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | 2^0 |
|**Value**| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1
|**On/Off**| **0** | **0** | **0** | **1** | **1** | **1** | **1** | **1** |

Lets look at the binary number **00011111** using Table 1.1 again

To convert from binary to decimal is as simple as adding the numbers from the **Value** column together that have a corresponding **1** in the **On/Off** column.

In the example of **00011111**, we would add the numbers **1, 2, 4, 8, and 16**. This leaves us with **31**, meaning that the binary number **00011111** and the decimal number **31** are equivalent.
