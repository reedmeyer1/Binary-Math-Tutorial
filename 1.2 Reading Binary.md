# Reading Binary
## Lets look at the number **10101010**

| Table 1.1 | | | | | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Exponent** | 2^7 | 2^6 | 2^5 | 2^4 | 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | 2^0 |
|**Value**| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1
|**On/Off**| **1** | **0** | **1** | **0** | **1** | **0** | **1** | **0** |

### Understanding Table 1.1
As we covered in Chapter 1.1: Understanding Binary Conceptually, each **1** or **0** in a binary number is called a **bit** and **8 bits** equal one **byte**. A **byte** can store any number from **0** to **255** using only **8** numbers or **bits**. This is done using exponents as shown in **Table 1.1**.

Each **bit** in a **byte** has a different exponent of **2** associated with it, **increasing** from **right** to **left**.
#### Lets break down the rows
In the **On/Off** row, notice how each number corresponds to the binary number we are solving for, this is because with binary numbers **1** means **on** and **0** means **off**.

In the **Exponents** row and the **Value** row, notice how the numbers in the **Value** row are actually the **same** as the **Exponent** row. This is done to help simplify the process.

#### Reading **10101010**
Reading an binary number is as simple as adding the numbers from the **Value** row that have a corresponding **1** in the **On/Off** row. Any values with a corresponding **0** in the  **On/Off** row can be ignored.

In total four numbers should be added together, **128**, **32**, **8**, and **2**.
 This means the the binary number **10101010** is equivalent to **170**.
