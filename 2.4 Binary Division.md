# Binary Division
Lets look at the numbers **00000100** and **00000011**

Unlike binary multiplication, binary division is its own beast and is the most difficult of all to master.

Lets go over two terms:
- Divisor: The number we are dividing by
- Dividend: The number being divided into

### Step by Step:
1. Create a working number. Moving from left to right on the dividend, keep including numbers until they exceed the divisor.

2. After a working number is created, find out how many times it goes into the dividend.

3. Subtract the divisor from the working number.

4. Bring down digits from the dividend until they exceed the divisor again.

5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 until the divisor completely divides the dividend.

6. The result of the subtraction tree is the remainder.

### Lets double check that!
You should ALWAYS double check your work and the best way to do that with binary math is to convert it to something more familiar. However since conversions will be covered later on in *Chapter 3*, they will be given for this example.

Lets look at the original Figure 2.6:
![](https://github.com/reedmeyer1/Binary-Math-Tutorial/blob/master/2.4%2001.png?raw=true)
The blue number, **00000010**, is equal to the decimal number **2** and the red number, **00011110**, is equal to the number **30**. Meaning dividing the values **00000010** and **00011110** in binary is the same as dividing the more familiar **2** and **30**. Since we know **2 / 30 = 15**, then **00001111** should be equal to **15**, which it is. The conversion process will be covered to a more full extent in *Chapter 3*.
